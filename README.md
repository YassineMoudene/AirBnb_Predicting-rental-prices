# AirBnb_Predicting-rental-prices

This case study is about predicting the rental price for an apartment ordered by Airbnb in London. The goal is to predict the price that may be appropriate for an apartment with certain features. This prediction can help answer various business questions. One such question is what revenue we could expect if we invested in an apartment in London and rented it via Airbnb. Another question is finding a good deal for one night in a specific neighborhood. To plan for that, we have to know what rental price we can expect to receive for various kinds of apartment at various locations of the city.

The location (borough) of the apartments will be one of their features. With a wide range of locations, our predictive model has to be able to capture potential interactions between locations and other apartment features. We need a model that is expected to give a very good prediction, but we also need a model that can be implemented quickly. After feature engineering, we have 65 variables in total, including a set of binary variables. The data includes various types of apartments (houses, rooms, apartments). Unless it's necessary to distinguish among these, we'll call them apartments. The dataset has N = 51 646 observations. We dropped very large units (that can accommodate eight or more people), and we dropped some observations for which important variables were missing.
